# Bivariate Simplex Distribution (BSD)

This article aims to propose a bivariate Simplex distribution for modeling data defined on the unit interval (0, 1) as an alternative to the bivariate Beta distribution. The properties of this distribution are presented analytically. The maximum likelihood method is used to obtain the estimators. The Fisher Information matrix is used to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the estimators.
