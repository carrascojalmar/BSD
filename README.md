# Bivariate Simplex Distribution (BSD)

This article proposes a bivariate Simplex distribution for modeling continuous outcomes limited to the interval (0, 1). The properties of this distribution are presented analytically. The maximum likelihood method is used to obtain the estimators. Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators. The results are illustrated in a Jurimetric data set.
